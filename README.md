Hi! My name is ***Ahad*** and this repository hold all my assignments which I have submitted in my time during my course at ***QSipders Wakad, Pune, India.***

***This repository is supposed to be veiwed as an evidence for all my submissions to the assignments which were presented by QSpiders.*** If you are a student at this institute or any other institute, you may use this repository as a ***reference material to aid your learning process.***

However, I would really want you to try out solving the porblems first and then using this repository as a guide if you can't sovle it. **Please do not just copy the codes from tihs repository as this will not help you.**

Towards the end, I wish you all the best in you journey and I hope you become successful in which ever endeavour you are planning to go ahead with.
